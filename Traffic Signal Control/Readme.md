# Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-Based Traffic Signal Controllers

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to learn decision-making skills through trial and error. DRL has been applied to various domains, including robotics, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, and has shown promising results in improving decision-making and control.

One of the promising applications of DRL is traffic signal control, which aims to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion on the road. Traditional traffic signal controllers rely on fixed timing plans or pre-defined rules, which may not be effective in handling dynamic traffic conditions. In contrast, DRL-based traffic signal controllers can learn to adapt to changing traffic conditions and optimize signal timings in real-time.

Several DRL-based traffic signal controllers have been proposed in recent years, including the Max Pressure algorithm, the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. These algorithms have shown promising results in improving traffic flow and reducing travel time in simulations and real-world experiments.

The code runs a training loop for a specified number of episodes. In each episode, the code sets up the SUMO simulation environment and resets the traffic light phase to 0. It then enters a loop where it updates the Q-value estimator model using a batch of experiences stored in replay memory. At each iteration of the loop, the code selects an action based on an epsilon-greedy policy and applies it to the environment. The resulting state and reward are stored in the replay memory.

The code also collects statistics on the delay time of vehicles in the simulation and calculates the average Q-value length per episode. The final trained Q-value estimator model is saved after each episode.

The code is using a deep Q-learning algorithm with a target network and experience replay. It appears to be using a cubic absolute reward function and a random action penalty to encourage exploration.

Overall, the code is implementing a basic reinforcement learning algorithm to train an agent to optimize traffic light control in a simulated traffic environment.
