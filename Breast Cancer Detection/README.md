# Introduction

This code demonstrates how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using the Keras library with the TensorFlow backend. The CNN is trained on a binary classification task to distinguish between histopathologic images of lymph node sections with and without metastatic cancer.

# Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or later
TensorFlow 2.0 or later
Keras 2.2 or later
Pandas 1.0 or later
Matplotlib 3.1 or later
Seaborn 0.10 or later
OpenCV 4.2 or later

# Usage

Run the code in a Python environment with the required libraries installed.
Ensure that the input data is stored in the input directory as follows:
train_labels.csv : a CSV file containing the training labels for each image
train : a directory containing the training images in TIFF format
test : a directory containing the test images in TIFF format (not used in this code)
Run the code in a Jupyter notebook or a Python script to train the CNN and generate predictions for the validation set.
The trained model will be saved in the models directory with a timestamp in the filename.
The training and validation loss and accuracy plots will be saved in the plots directory with a timestamp in the filename.

# Method

The CNN architecture consists of four blocks of two convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max pooling and batch normalization. Each block increases the number of filters and reduces the spatial resolution of the feature maps. The output of the last block is flattened and fed into three fully connected layers with ReLU activation, followed by dropout regularization. The final layer has a sigmoid activation for binary classification. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

The training data is preprocessed using data augmentation, which involves random horizontal and vertical flips, random rotations, random zoom, and random brightness shifts. The validation data is not augmented.

The training is done using the fit_generator method of the Keras Sequential model, which generates batches of augmented images on-the-fly from the input data. The validation is done using the evaluate_generator method, which generates batches of non-augmented images on-the-fly from the input data. The predictions on the validation set are generated using the predict_generator method.

# Results

The model achieves a validation accuracy of around 0.82 after 30 epochs of training. The training and validation loss and accuracy plots show a typical pattern of overfitting, where the training accuracy continues to increase while the validation accuracy plateaus and then decreases. The model could be further improved by using regularization techniques such as weight decay or early stopping, or by fine-tuning a pre-trained model.
